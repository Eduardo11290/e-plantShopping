The e-Plant Shopping application is a React-based web project that allows users to browse plant products and manage a shopping cart. The app demonstrates core front-end development concepts such as component-based design, state management using Redux, and dynamic UI updates.

Users can add plants to their cart, adjust item quantities, remove items, and view real-time updates to the total cost. The application focuses on clean structure, reusable components, and an intuitive user experience.

This project was built as part of a learning exercise to practice React, Redux, and modern JavaScript development techniques.
